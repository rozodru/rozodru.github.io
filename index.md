## About Drew
<ul>
    I've been a front end web dev for over 20 years. I've worked in various industries including adult entertainment, mobile advertising, social media, and indiependant music artists. Some of my past clients include the band <i>Our Last Night</i>, mobile telecom Fido, Universal Pictures, Paramount Pictures, Adult Industry company Pink Visual, Suicide Girls, and many more.
    Once known as a "rock star bad boy" in the industry (or maybe I just called myself that) I took some time off and now I'm looking to get back into the field and make development "cool" again.
